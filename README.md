# Predicting-Insurance-Charges
I develop a regression model using XGBoost to predict insurance charges for customers of different demographic. 
The process involves exploratory data analysis, data cleaning techniques and feature engineering.
The XGBoost model was trained using a 5-fold cross validation and the output was evaluated using R-Squared.
I calculated the models feature importance and identified that the engineered features contributed signifficantly to the model's performance
